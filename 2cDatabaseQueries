SELECT Hotel.name, COUNT(Rooms.room_num) AS available_rooms
FROM Hotel
JOIN Rooms ON Hotel.hotel_id = Rooms.hotel_id
WHERE Rooms.status = 'available'
GROUP BY Hotel.name
ORDER BY available_rooms DESC;

SELECT h.name, h.hotel_address
FROM Hotel h
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(b.booking_id)
       FROM Booking b
       JOIN Rooms r ON b.room_num = r.room_num
       WHERE r.hotel_id = h.hotel_id) > 10;

SELECT c.name, COUNT(DISTINCT h.chain_id) AS number_of_chains
FROM Customer c
JOIN Booking b ON c.customer_id = b.customer_id
JOIN Rooms r ON b.room_num = r.room_num
JOIN Hotel h ON r.hotel_id = h.hotel_id
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT h.chain_id) > 1;
